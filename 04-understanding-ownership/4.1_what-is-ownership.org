* What is Ownership?
Ownership is how memory is managed in Rust, instead of a garbage collector. It checks at compile time, and so can keep code save without overhead at run time.

* The Stack and the Heap
** The Stack
- LIFO: Last in, first out
  - Like a stack of plates: you add to the top, and remove from the top as well
- Adding to the top: Pushing to the stack
- Removing from the top: Popping off the stack
- All data in the stack has a known, fixed size
  - This means it is used to store data that has a known size at compile time.
** The Heap
- When data is put, memory is requested from the memory allocator
- to

* Ownership Rules

* Variable Scope
#+BEGIN_SRC rustic
let s = "hello rust";
println!("{}", s);
{
    let s = "hello world";
    println!("{}", s);
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello rust
: hello world
