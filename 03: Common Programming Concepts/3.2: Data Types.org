#+title: 3.2: Data Types
+ Every value has a /data type/
+ The type of every value must be known at compile time
  + This can often be inferred by the compiler
  + It has to be manually annotated at certain times:
    #+begin_src rust
    let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number");
    #+end_src
    + The compiler cannot know what type should be parsed without an annotation
* Scalar Types
+ A /scalar type/ is a single value
+ There are 4 primary scalar types:
  1. integers
  2. floating-point numbers
  3. Booleans
  4. characters
** Integer Types
| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
|---------+--------+----------|
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |
